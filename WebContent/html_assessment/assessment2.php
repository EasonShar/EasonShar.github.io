				<p>The woman in this photograph has been identified as both
					Hilda Urlin Petrie and Amy Urlin. The two women were sisters -
					Hilda Petrie was married to Flinders Petrie, while Amy Urlin was
					unmarried. The Urlin family was relatively wealthy, and had homes
					in Sussex and London. Amy was born in 1865, Hilda in 1871. Like
					many unmarried Victorian ladies, Amy Urlin kept busy helping the
					less fortunate. She was part of the Charity Organisation Society, a
					Victorian institution devoted to addressing poverty and family
					problems.</p>
				<p>After her marriage to Flinders Petrie, Hilda wrote letters to
					Amy when the Petries were excavating in Egypt. Amy joined Hilda and
					Flinders Petrie at Abydos for the 1900/1901 season.</p>
				<p>Amy was put in charge of pottery fragments. Hilda recorded in
					her diary that Amy spent hours carefully fitting pieces of ancient
					bowls together. With a special adhesive mixture called seccotine,
					she glued the pieces together. The completed bowls would then be
					given to Flinders Petrie to draw.</p>
				<p>Hilda Petrie was a formidable figure to many of Petrie's
					students and associates. During her teenage years she had formed a
					friendship with the daughter of noted suffrage campaigner Millicent
					Garrett Fawcett. On arriving in Egypt for the first time in 1896,
					she replaced her skirts with practical trousers. During excavations
					she copied inscriptions so inaccessible that she drew them while
					lying on the ground. These copies ended up in the publications
					Petrie became noted for producing quickly after the end of the
					excavation season.</p>
				<p>During the 1902/1903 season, the last excavation the Petries
					conducted at Abydos for decades, Hilda and two other women,
					Margaret Murray and Winfred Hansard, were able to conduct a small
					excavation themselves - in an area near the back of Seti I's temple
					called the Osireion.</p>
				<p>Hilda also played a significant role in fundraising for
					excavations - she was one of two Honorary Secretaries for the
					British School of Archaeology in Egypt, gathering subscriptions to
					send Petrie's students to Egypt to obtain excavation experience.
					Her contributions to publicising and fundraising were marked. She
					lectured extensively at women's clubs and literary societies, and
					by the 1930s she was giving radio broadcasts on the excavations in
					Palestine.</p>
